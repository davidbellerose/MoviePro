MoviesController.Details method check if already in db and flag if so
        and remove import button or change its icon and message
        above title: movie in xxx collection
        detail view should have the dropdown that will import it to the selected collection
        in detail title section; form for import as above
        if already in, detail will go to db version
        title block will show personal rating(not yet rated) and expandable notes.
        might need componant view
        change to watch collection after done watching.

IMPORT LIBRARY - The library is the imported movies, rename to My Movies
****************************
MoviesController.Library method doesn't have view, may need to scaffold this controller
the library/view is the local db list
	clicking on its detail goes to api detail
	the import view needs a select for collection
	maybe watch list can be a collection name
		with watched bool.
MoviesController is for the api movies
i think i need library views scaffolded with crud
i might need a library controller
but library method is in moviescontroller
	which imports to db


***************************
    FEATURES
****************************
	have personal rating
    have comments

   NOTES
******************************************************

MoviesController Details view checks if request from api or db  version
    import method to add to database

MovieCollection is the join table for many-to-many movie-collection

MovieCollectionsController.index, for selct boxes to move moveis to and from collection

the library looks like the movies that were imported into db

----------------------------------------------------

The startup.cs line `services.Configure<AppSettings>(Configuration.GetSection("AppSettings"));`
	puts the json data into an "AppSettings" class (or object?).

The Settings/AppSettings is a container for the TMDBSettings and MovieProSettings.
	The TMDBSettings has class/properties for the API image/video data, base url, query options etc.
	The MovieProSettings has class/properties to represent the API credentials.

The _appSettings (AppSettings.TMDBSettings) is injected into the constructor of
	the TMDBMovieService where the request and response info is retrieved using
	the AppSettings(API info) class. The MovieDetailAsync method gets _appSettings,
	then instantiates and returns a new movieDetail object based on the MovieDetail class(model).
	this is an object populated with the info from the api.

The TMDBMappingService.MapMovieDetailAsync method
		maps the data into the newMovie class properties.
			so when does the newMovie class become an object, in the controller?
	? the mapping service takes the MovieDetail(api version),  and maps(transfers?)
		the data to an instance of the Movie class/model
		via the MoviesController.Import method. (Is this projection?)
		The movie is imported/added to the local/app SQL database
		It's a copy from the API stored in the app db.


TMDBMovieService => public async Task<MovieDetail> MovieDetailAsync(int id)
Models/TMDB/MovieDetail
	returning an instance of MovieDetail based on MovieDetail model/class.
this has movie info from api

TMDBMappingService => public async Task<Movie> MapMovieDetailAsync(MovieDetail movie)
Models/Database/Movie
	It's a method that takes in an instance of MovieDetail and returns an instance of Movie
	? mapping vs. projection?

MoviesController
public async Task<IActionResult> Import(int id)
var movieDetail = await _movieService.MovieDetailAsync(id);
		// gets the movie from the api
var movie = await _mappingService.MapMovieDetailAsync(movieDetail);
		// maps the data to copy it into the movie object
		// now the controller can put a copy in the database
		// keep the api and database versions separate

If you watch the intro video to this project
 you will see that only the api part is constructed
 all the other parts shown in the intro video are not done.
